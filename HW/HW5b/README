The present file is the second part of a 3-part homework, that
will all be turned in together.

Part 1 had involved writing a sed program to identify flushes
and four-of-a-kinds. (Part 3 will complete that sed program,
to identify the other situations -- but I have not yet given
you the instructions on how to implement it.)

As for this present Part 2, it involves filling in the blanks
in the testertemplate.csh script:
  % ls
  README  allcards  testeroutput.png  testertemplate.csh
  %

You should fill in the blanks according to the instructions
given in the template, then remove all of the comments, then
rename the file to "tester.csh", then make it an executable.

Also provided is testeroutput.png, which shows the expected
output behavior.
